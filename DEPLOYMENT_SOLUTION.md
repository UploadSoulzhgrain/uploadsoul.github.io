# Deployment Solution Guide

## Understanding the Issue
The website isn't showing updates despite successful GitHub pushes and deployment attempts. This is likely due to a combination of issues:

1. **Domain Configuration Issues**: The CNAME file was missing for GitHub Pages
2. **Vercel Build Script Permissions**: The build script wasn't properly executable
3. **Dual Deployment Setup**: No fallback deployment mechanism

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed GitHub Pages Domain Configuration
- Added a `CNAME` file with `uploadsoul.com` to properly configure the custom domain
- This ensures GitHub Pages knows which domain to associate with your site

### 2. Enhanced Vercel Configuration
- Fixed the `vercel.json` configuration to ensure proper build commands
- Added automatic permission setting for the build script
- Improved the build command sequence to ensure all dependencies are properly installed

### 3. Created Dual Deployment Workflow
- Added a new GitHub workflow in `.github/workflows/dual-deploy.yml`
- This workflow deploys to both GitHub Pages AND Vercel simultaneously
- If one deployment fails, the other will still be available, ensuring redundancy

## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Required Secrets
For the Vercel deployment to work via GitHub Actions, you need to add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

- Go to your GitHub repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
- Add the following secrets:
  - `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel personal access token
  - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel organization ID
  - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID

### 2. Force a Clean Deployment
To ensure all changes take effect:

```bash
# Push changes to GitHub to trigger the new workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed deployment configuration"
git push origin main

# For direct Vercel deployment, run:
pnpm run build
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Clear Browser Cache
After deployment completes, make sure to:

- Clear your browser cache completely (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try accessing the site in an incognito/private window
- Try accessing from a different device or network

## DNS Configuration Check

Verify that your domain's DNS records are correctly pointing to both GitHub Pages and Vercel:

### For GitHub Pages
- Add an `A` record pointing to GitHub Pages IPs:
  - 185.199.108.153
  - 185.199.109.153
  - 185.199.110.153
  - 185.199.111.153
- Add a `CNAME` record from `www` to `uploadsoulzhgrain.github.io`

### For Vercel
- Add a `CNAME` record from your root domain to `cname.vercel-dns.com`

## Troubleshooting

If you still face issues:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for any build errors
2. Verify Vercel deployment logs in the Vercel dashboard
3. Test accessibility directly using the GitHub Pages URL: `https://uploadsoulzhgrain.github.io`
4. Test accessibility directly using the Vercel URL (found in your Vercel dashboard)

## Maintenance

This dual-deployment setup provides redundancy and reliability. Moving forward:

- Use GitHub pushes for all updates - the automatic workflows will handle deployment
- Monitor both deployment channels to ensure they stay in sync
- If one deployment platform has issues, you can temporarily use the other until resolved
