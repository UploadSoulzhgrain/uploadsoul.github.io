# Deployment Instructions for UploadSoul Project

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive instructions for deploying the UploadSoul project to Vercel. We've made several optimizations to ensure smooth deployment.

## Pre-deployment Checklist

1. Ensure all code is committed and pushed to the repository
2. Verify that the Vercel project is linked to the correct repository
3. Check that environment variables are properly configured in Vercel

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. Log in to the Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click 'Import' if it's a new project, or 'Redeploy' if updating an existing project
4. The enhanced build script will handle the rest

### Option 2: Deploy via Command Line

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

This command will build the project and deploy it to Vercel.

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails, check the logs generated by the build script (`vercel-build.sh`). These logs provide detailed information about each step of the build process.

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **PNPM Version Mismatch**: We've specified PNPM version 8.10.2 in both .npmrc and vercel.json. If you're using a different version locally, consider updating.

2. **Memory Issues**: The build script allocates 4GB of memory for Node.js. If you're seeing out-of-memory errors, you may need to adjust the `NODE_OPTIONS` flag.

3. **Routing Issues**: We've added both Netlify `_redirects` and Vercel routing configurations. If you're seeing 404 errors for client-side routes, ensure these files are correctly copied to the build output.

4. **Dependency Issues**: If there are package conflicts, try cleaning the cache:
   ```bash
   pnpm store prune
   pnpm install --force
   ```

## Post-deployment Verification

After deployment, verify that:

1. The application loads correctly
2. Client-side routing works (try navigating directly to a route)
3. All features (including multilingual support and voice chat) function as expected
