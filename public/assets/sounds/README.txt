# Memory Game Sound Effects

This directory should contain sound effect files for the memory game.

Required sound files:
1. match.mp3 - A positive, cheerful sound that plays when a player finds a matching pair
2. nomatch.mp3 - A neutral sound that plays when a player flips two cards that do not match

Recommended sound specifications:
- Format: MP3
- Duration: Short (0.5-2 seconds)
- Volume: Normalized and not too loud

In a production environment, you would replace these with actual sound effects.
These sounds enhance the game experience but should be subtle and not distracting.

Additional sounds you might consider adding:
- game-start.mp3 - Sound for when a new game begins
- game-complete.mp3 - Celebratory sound for when the game is completed
- card-flip.mp3 - Soft sound for the card flipping action
