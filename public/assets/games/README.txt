# Memory Game Images

This directory should contain the following image files for the memory game:

1. memory-game.png - A thumbnail image for the memory game in the game selection menu (300x200px recommended)
2. default-game.png - A default image used when specific game thumbnails are not available (300x200px recommended)

For best results, use consistent sizes and styles for all game thumbnails.

In a production environment, you would replace these with actual game illustrations or screenshots.

Example image suggestions:
- For memory-game.png: A grid of colorful cards with some flipped to reveal matching pairs
- For default-game.png: A simple icon or graphic representing games in general
